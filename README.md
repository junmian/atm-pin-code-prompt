# ATM PIN Code Prompt

## Program Description
This program simulates a simplified ATM machine that displays the account balance for its user. The program prompts the user to enter their PIN number. The user has a maximum of three attempts to enter the correct PIN before they are locked out of their account. If the correct value is entered, a message indicating the account balance displays and the program ends. The valid PIN is “5289”. 

As this is a simplified version of what a typical ATM can do, the full range of functionality is currently limited to PIN verification and checking the account balance. To deposit and to withdraw funds are examples of additional features to include in the future. 

## To use the program:
- Install Python (prerequisite)
- In Command Prompt, run ```atm_pin_code_prompt.py```
